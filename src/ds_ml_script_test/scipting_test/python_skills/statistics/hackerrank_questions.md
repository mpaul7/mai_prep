### Hackerrank-style Statistics Questions

#### Q1. Pearson Correlation
Given a CSV with numeric columns `x` and `y`, compute the Pearson correlation coefficient rounded to 3 decimals. Drop rows with missing values in either column.

Output: a single line containing the correlation (e.g., `0.612`).

#### Q2. Binomial Tail Probability
Given integers `n`, `k` and probability `p` (0<=p<=1) via CLI arguments, compute `P(X >= k)` for `X ~ Binomial(n, p)` and print with 5 decimals.

#### Q3. Conditional Probability from Contingency
Given a CSV with columns `group` (categorical) and `flag` (boolean or 0/1), compute `P(group = target | flag = 1)` where `target` is provided via CLI.

Output: print the probability with 3 decimals.
